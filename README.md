# bubble-reader
reads bubble sheets

This project is inspired by PyImageSearch's bubble sheet reader, but this version is much more practical. It uses QR code-style markers to denote the location of columns, and supports two columns per sheet. paper.png is the sheet that this program was designed to read.
